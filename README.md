###  Hello👋,

I'm a **passionate Full Stack developer** 💻 specialising in crafting innovative web and mobile solutions. With a focus on React.js, React Native, and Next.js, I'm dedicated to building applications that deliver an exceptional user experience. 🚀

As a _project manager_ 🎯, I've honed key skills in leadership and management, demonstrating a strong proficiency in using Git for version control and effective team collaboration on projects. 🤝

My interest in **entrepreneurship** 🚀 consistently drives me to seek growth opportunities and innovation. Equipped to understand commercial needs, I propose solutions and ensure their technical implementation. 💼

_Creativity_ 🎨 and art are essential elements of my work. They inspire me to envisage unique solutions and add a unique touch to every project I undertake. 🌈

Always on the lookout for new opportunities and challenges, I am eager to continue learning and evolving. 🔝 Don't hesitate to contact me to discuss how I might bring value to your team.

If you have any ideas or projects in mind, I'd be delighted to discuss them with you and try to meet your needs.

**Kind regards,**
Johan 🖋️
