**👋 Hi there!** 

I’m a BI Analytics Engineer with 6+ years of IT dominance, crushing it with advanced SQL, Big Data modeling, and scalable dashboards. Formerly a Full Stack maestro, I now weaponize data to slash costs and skyrocket KPIs for the world’s top tech players.

**💡 Passionate** 

I turn raw data into strategic gold using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker, backed by battle-tested data warehousing on Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift. My code doesn’t just work—it wins.

**🎨 Design Meets Data** 

With an eye for aesthetics from my web/mobile dev days, I craft dashboards that don’t just inform—they captivate. Beauty and function? I deliver both.

**🖥️ Tech Arsenal** 

Advanced SQL & Big Data: Taming massive datasets like a pro.
Dashboarding: Building scalable, high-impact visuals that drive decisions.
Full Stack Roots: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Next.js, React Native.
Project Leadership: Agile master, delivering on time, every time.

**🚀 Tools I Wield**

GitHub, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Figma, Git—ready to tackle any challenge GAFAM throws my way.

**🧰 Development Tools** 

With a suite of tools like GitHub, Express.js, Node.js, React.js, React Native, Figma, MongoDB, Next.js and Git at my disposal, I am ready to take on any challenge.

## :computer: My Coding Routine :
<p align="center">
As a Developer, my daily life operates in a cycle that blends productivity and continuous learning seamlessly. Here's what it looks like:
</p>

1. **Coding:** Programming isn't just what I do—it's a passion that drives me. Be it tackling a complex problem or exploring a new technology, coding always presents an exciting challenge that brings immense satisfaction.

2. **Eating:** Proper nutrition is vital for a sharp mind. Regular, balanced meals keep my energy levels steady, fueling efficient coding sessions and productive days.

3. **Sleeping:** Quality rest is the unsung hero of productivity. A good night's sleep helps me recharge, renew, and get ready for another fruitful day of coding.

<p align="center">
  In essence, my routine is code, eat, sleep, and repeat. It's more than just a schedule—it's a balanced lifestyle that keeps my passion for programming alive and drives me to strive for excellence.
